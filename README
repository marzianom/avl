A simple but effective AVL tree library.

Warning:
   a) sizeof(void *) == sizeof(long) is assumed, and
   b) a single thread is assumed.

For the time being, please read the comments in the .h file.
A more comprehensive README will follow.

For forward compatibility, do not use the avl_tree() and the *_f_*() functions.

The current version is optimized for lookup speed (under certain conditions), not for space.

Please report any problems you may encounter to waltertross at gmail.
